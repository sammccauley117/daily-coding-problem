# Daily Coding Problems
## Problem 1
**Name**: String to Integer (atoi)<br>
**Difficulty**: Medium<br>
**Source**: LeetCode<br>
**Python Score**: 40ms (94th percentile)<br>
**C++ Score**: 8ms (89th percentile)<br>

Implement `atoi` which converts a string to an integer. The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value. The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function. If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed. If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned. Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31,  2^31 − 1]. If the numerical value is out of the range of representable values, INT_MAX (2^31 − 1) or INT_MIN (−2^31) is returned.

## Problem 2
**Name**: Two Sum<br>
**Difficulty**: Easy<br>
**Source**: LeetCode<br>
**Python Score**: 32ms (83rd percentile)<br>
**C++ Score**: 8ms (98th percentile)<br>

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Problem 3
**Name**: Compare Version Numbers<br>
**Difficulty**: Medium<br>
**Source**: LeetCode<br>
**C++ Score**: 0ms (100th percentile)<br>

Compare two version numbers *version1* and *version2*.
If version1 > version2 `return 1;` if version1 < version2 `return -1;` otherwise `return 0;`. You may assume that the version strings are non-empty and contain only digits and the `.` character. The `.` character does not represent a decimal point and is used to separate number sequences. For instance, `2.5` is not "two and a half" or "half way to version three", it is the fifth second-level revision of the second first-level revision. You may assume the default revision number for each level of a version number to be `0`. For example, version number `3.4` has a revision number of `3` and `4` for its first and second level revision number. Its third and fourth level revision number are both `0`.

## Problem 4
**Name**: Roman to Integer<br>
**Difficulty**: Easy<br>
**Source**: LeetCode<br>
**Python Score**: 48ms (99th percentile)<br>
**C++ Score**: 12ms (95th percentile)<br>

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`. For example, two is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, `XII`, which is simply `X` + `II`. The number twenty seven is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX` + `V` + `II`. Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.
- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.
- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

**C++ Score**: 0ms (100th percentile)<br>

Given an array *nums* and a value *val*, remove all instances of that value **in-place** and return the new length. Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory. The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

```
Example 1:
Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,
Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

Example 2:
Given nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2,
Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 1, 3, 0, and 4.
Note that the order of those five elements can be arbitrary.
```

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

## Problem 71
**Name**: Implement strStr<br>
**Difficulty**: Easy<br>
**Source**: LeetCode<br>
**C++ Score**: 4ms (91st percentile)<br>

Implement strStr(). Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

```
Example 1:
Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
```
Clarification: For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

## Problem 72
**Name**: Encode and Decode TinyURL<br>
**Difficulty**: Easy<br>
**Source**: LeetCode<br>
**Python Score**: 24ms (46th percentile)<br>

TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as `https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl` and it returns a short URL such as `http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk`. Design the `encode` and `decode` methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.

**Difficulty**: Easy<br>
**Source**: LeetCode<br>
**C++ Score**: 16ms (67th percentile)<br>

Given a *non-empty* array of integers, every element appears *twice* except for one. Find that single one. Note: your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4

## Problem 75
**Name**: Reverse Integer (Swift)<br>
**Difficulty**: Easy<br>
**Source**: LeetCode<br>
**Swift Score**: 8ms (76th percentile)<br>

Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer. Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31,  2^31 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

## Problem 76
**Name**: Valid Parentheses (Swift)<br>
**Difficulty**: Easy<br>
**Source**: LeetCode<br>
**Swift Score**: 4ms (97th percentile)<br>

Given a string containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`, determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if:

- Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
- Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

Note that an empty string is also considered valid. Examples:

```
Input: "()"
Output: true

Input: "()[]{}"
Output: true

Input: "(]"
Output: false

Input: "([)]"
Output: false

Input: "{[]}"
Output: true
```

## Problem 77

## Problem 78
**Name**: Palindrome Number (Swift)<br>
**Difficulty**: Easy<br>
**Source**: LeetCode<br>
**Swift Score**: 52ms (36th percentile)<br>

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

```
Example 1:
Input: 121
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:
Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```
